This is my first homework assignment, I refactored the code I was initially given and presented the client with a cleaner version for both the HTML file and CSS file.

## Description 

The purpose of this assignment is to provide a codebase that follows accessibility standards making the site more optimized for search engines. Throughout the file you will find semantic html elements that follow in a logical structure. I have also included my notes on both the HTML and CSS files.
